Print out this email and use it to help you pack for camping.  This list
is simply a guide to help you decide what to bring.  If you absolutely
need something that's not on this list, then bring it.  If you can do
without it for a weekend, then it's probably better to leave it at home so
it doesn't weigh you down and/or get broken/lost/stolen/etc.

 Suggestions:
  1. Please do NOT bring any glass items
  2. If the list doesn't say "optional" then you'll probably need it
  3. The checklist of items includes anything you're wearing on Friday
  4. Pack light and small and try to bring old, worn out stuff
  5. Pack stuff inside multiple, redundant waterproof layers
  6. Pick light coloured clothing to keep cooler and reduce bug attraction

Each person is responsible for all of his/her equipment.  If you forget to
bring something then you'll have to make do without it.  Each person is
also responsible for making everybody aware of any food or other allergies
that you may have prior to when we buy food.

I recommend that if you wear contact lenses you should just leave them at
home and bring your glasses instead.  It'll save you a lot of hassle and
it's a little safer.
