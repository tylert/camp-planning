Print out the personal equipment list and use it to help you pack for
camping.  This list is simply a guide to help you decide what to bring.  If
you absolutely need something that's not on this list, then bring it.  If you
can do without it for a weekend, then it's probably better to leave it at
home.  Please try to follow the equipment selection suggestions below.

Each person is responsible for all of his/her equipment.  Each person is also
responsible for making everybody aware of any food or other allergies that
you may have prior to when we buy food.

I recommend that if you wear contact lenses, you should just leave them at
home and bring your glasses instead.  It'll save you a lot of hassle and it's
a little safer.

Equipment Selection Suggestions
 1. Please pack light and small as the campsite is accessible only by canoe
 2. Try to bring only old, worn-out stuff
 3. The checklist includes everything worn or brought on the trip up
 4. Please pack stuff inside separate, double-redundant plastic bags
 5. Pick light coloured clothing to keep cooler and reduce bug attraction
 6. Please do NOT bring any glass items
