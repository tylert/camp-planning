Each person is responsible for all of his/her equipment.  Each person is also
responsible for making everybody else aware of any allergies or medical
concerns prior to when we leave.

Print out the personal equipment list and use it to help you pack for camping.
This list is simply a guide to help you decide what to bring.  If you
absolutely need something that's not on this list, then bring it.  If you can
do without it for a weekend, then it's probably better to leave it at home.
Also, please try to follow the following additional guidelines/notes:

  1. The checklist includes everything worn or brought on the trip up
  2. Pack light and small as the campsite is accessible only by canoe
  3. Pack stuff inside separate, double-redundant plastic bags
  4. Try to bring mostly waterproof stuff that isn't terribly fragile
  5. Try to bring only old, worn-out stuff
  6. Pick light coloured clothing to keep cooler and reduce bug attraction
  7. Please do NOT bring any items which will generate excessive/bulky garbage
