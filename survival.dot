/*
First off, if you end up in a survival situation, you are almost certainly
badly in need of help.  Either your vehicle crashed or you plum got lost, some
of your party may be in need of medical attention and you likely don't have a
convenience store nearby when you get a hankering for a nice, cool beverage.
For this reason, the main focus of this kit is to get you back to civilization.

Everything in this kit can be classified in one of two categories:

  - Items that serve to help your party get rescued
  - Items that serve to help keep your party alive long enough to get rescued
